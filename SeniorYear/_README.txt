This folder contains several different projects, the foremost of which is a randomize button for the game super smash brothers. However, the part that makes it interesting is the associated webscraper. This was my first introduction, to web scraping and especially with scraping rendered HTML. Currently there are more planned features than I have time to create them, but I can't wait until I have time to expand on this.

The other important project is the shader playground. This contains, shaders created in OpenGL that are useful in changing how the graphics card draws images to the screen. I was able to learn and explore how to use advanced tactics to create day and night cycles. This program has a UI toggled by 'tab' and sliders that control certain global variables, as well as options to automate the movement of the sliders. You can move between rooms by pressing either the arrow keys or clicking on the arrow buttons.
The fourth slider controls the speed at which the sliders are automated. Press the button on the right of slider bars to automate them, and press the button on the left to change behavior.

Another notable project from senior year is the scouting group generator. This was a program I made for my robotics team designed to use data collected from a google form to create schedules for my teammates during compeition to ensure that the team had workers to collect data for analysis that I will be spearheading during competiton. 

Most of the other projects are either small jokes or are something I created as a placeholder to remind me to work on it in the future, such as the pokemon files. My older brother thought it would be cool to collaborate on a multiplayer pokemon style game in the future, so I implemented some basic mechanics to remind myself whenever I look in the folder that I still think it would be an interesting challenge.
