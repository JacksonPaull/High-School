This folder shows 4 exe's for 4 games made in gamemaker over my junior year. 

The first is a game wherein I implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm.
This is done through creating a ds map that contains data finding where a computer controlled entity can walk, then proceeding with the algorithm to find the shortest path to the player object. The player can be controlled with WASD, and the pathfinding starts when the player walks close to the skeleton, indicated by the circles.

The second is a recreation of pong with paddles being controlled with WS and up and down arrows respectively. There is not much else to say about this golden classic, and I believe I did a pretty good job at recreating it.

The third is a very small game dedicated around defeating waves of enemies to gather a score. This was the first game I created and thus was more based on experiementing with the program rather than building something I was passionate about like the other two.
