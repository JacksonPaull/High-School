        <p>
            In the game, you play as the circle that moves around.<br />
            You can shoot the green enemy blobs, and recieve points for everything you kill<br />
            You have 3 lives, and everytime you get hit by an enemy your health goes down by 1<br />
            When your health reaches 0 you die, and restart the game
        </p>

                <b>Room One</b><br />
                <div class="indent2">
                    The game begins in the title room, with a background with 1 object, <br />
                    the background is a tileset, which is a fancy word for a sprite that was <br />
                    up into several small sprites that can interactively be drawn within the <br />
                    on the background.<br />
                    The object is a simple title control object, which initialized through a simple function that<br />
                    increases the opacity until a cap of 1 (Fig A.), then the title object checks every frame for the<br />
                    endter key to be released. Upon release the enter key will push the game into the next room

                    as well as bullets that the player fires that damage enemy health<br />
                    All rooms have the tileset based background from the previous room and I will omit discussing them henceforth<br />
