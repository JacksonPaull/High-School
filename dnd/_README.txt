This folder contains a small app I created to allow a friend of mine to run dungeon and dragons meetings more effeciently. He found trouble with keeping track of a lot of easily automatable tasks, as the room grew loud with the night, so I spent a day creating a small console app to automate those tasks. The app can be controlled after entering the secret password 'xd'. This password is by no means secure but was more of a joke than any attempt at securing this console. Other than that every command is relatively self explanatory and the console should account for all edge cases.

Use the 'help' command to list all of the commands I included
